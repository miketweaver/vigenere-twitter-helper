# vigenere-twitter-helper
A helper for anyone that runs a twitter bot similar to @ciphermonkey

So this project is sort of hodgepodge, but I wanted to learn how to use ImageMagick better so that's what I focused on. 

The code for the rest is pretty ugly. Sorry about that. 

# Use
`./generateText.py generate`

Follow the prompts. This will allow you to create 3 challenges and post them to twitter.

`./generateText.py {easy|medium|hard}`

This will allow you to generate an easy challenge, medium challenge, or hard challenge. It will not post to twitter or generate an image.

`./generateText.py`

This will generate and easy challenge, medium challenge, or hard challenge of the same challenge. It will not post to twitter or generate an image.

# Requirements

```
ImageMagick
pip install tweepy
python

Enter in your Twitter API Creds to generateText.py
```
