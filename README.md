# vigenere-twitter-helper
A helper for anyone that runs a twitter bot similar to @ciphermonkey

So this project is sort of hodgepodge, but I wanted to learn how to use ImageMagick better so that's what I focused on. 

The code for the rest is pretty ugly. Sorry about that. 

# Use
`./generateText.py generate`

And follow the prompts.

# Requirements

```
ImageMagick
pip install tweepy
python
```
